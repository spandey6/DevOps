 create a shell script program to swap to numbers and then print both variables after swapping on the console screen.


a=0
while [ "$a" -lt 10 ]    # this is loop1
do
   b="$a"
   while [ "$b" -ge 0 ]  # this is loop2
   do
      echo -n "$b "
      b=`expr $b - 1`
   done
   echo
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done



#!/bin/sh

# Example script to show the difference between sh and bash

# Define two variables
str1="hello"
str2="world"

# Use the test command to compare the strings
if test "$str1" = "$str2"; then
  echo "The strings are equal."
else
  echo "The strings are not equal."
fi

#!/bin/bash

# Example script to show the difference between sh and bash

# Define two variables
str1="hello"
str2="world"

# Use the built-in [[ ]] operator to compare the strings
if [[ "$str1" == "$str2" ]]; then
  echo "The strings are equal."
else
  echo "The strings are not equal."
